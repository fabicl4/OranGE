# Phase 0: Foundation

Basic implementation of:

- Logging system
- Time System
- Window Management

## Log

Should test in the future multiple window creation. In the code this is permitted, but i did not tested it


## Time

Basic implementation, need more work

## Events

This is how Events are handle in Hazel. In future iterations, i could be modify how the events are handled. For now on, this is more than enough.  The reset of the events types will be added when i need them.
