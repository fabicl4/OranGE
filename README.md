## Description
<!-- Description -->

OranGE is a learning-focused game engine project designed for experimentation and modification. Built incrementally from the ground up, it prioritizes clean architecture and educational value over production readiness.

The goals are:

The project goals are:

**Architecture**

- Render Hardware Interface (RHI) for API abstraction
- Data-oriented design principles
- Modular component-based architecture

**Rendering**

- Minimized OpenGL state changes through caching
- Render Command architecture with sorting/batching
- Frame Graph for render pass management

**Learning**

- Understand game engine architecture patterns
- Implement industry techniques (PBR, GPU-driven rendering)
- Build tooling for shader development and debugging

Feel free to copy or modify my code! :)

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### Application

Owns and manages subsystem lifetime: Window, Renderer (Front/Back), ResourceManager, and Scene.

#### Render Front (High-Level)

- Builds the frame by collecting RenderCommands from subsystems
- Sorts and batches commands by state (material, shader, texture)
- Manages frame data and render passes
- API-agnostic

```text
SpriteRenderer → Push RenderCommand
RendererSystem → Sort/Batch
Backend → Execute Commands
```

#### Render Back (Low-Level)

- Owns GPU resources (buffers, textures, shaders)
- Manages the OpenGL state machine
- Executes sorted command streams
- Implements state caching and lazy updates
- OpenGL-specific (but designed for future backends)

#### 3. **Resources**

```text
Subsystem → Handle → ResourceManager → Backend → OpenGL
```

Resource Manager:

- CPU-side metadata ownership
- Stable handles (not raw OpenGL IDs)
- Asynchronous loading pipeline

### Frame Flow

```text
Application
    ↓
RendererSystem.BeginFrame()
    ↓
Subsystem.Submit()
    ↓
RendererSystem.BuildRenderQueue()
    ↓
RendererBackend.Execute()
    ↓
RendererSystem.EndFrame()
```

**Advantages of this approach:**

- Centralized execution enables automatic batching
- Sorting by state minimizes driver overhead
- Command generation can be multithreaded
- Backend becomes a pure executor, simplifying debugging

## Libraries

### Core Libraries

| Library | Purpose | Integration |
